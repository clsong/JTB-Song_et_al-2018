Chuliang Song, Rudolf P. Rohr, Serguei Saavedra. "A guideline to study the feasibility domain of multi-trophic and changing ecological communities" Journal of Theoretical Biology, 2018.


The file contains the R-code: (1) to compute the normalized size of a feasibility domain, (2) to compute the overlap of two feasibility domains, (3) to compute the normalized size of a feasibility domain under linear biologically constraints.

**Warning**: This package is not maintained. Please refer to the R pacage [feasoverlap](https://github.com/clsong/feasoverlap) with updated functioning and bug fixes.
